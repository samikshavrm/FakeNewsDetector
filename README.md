## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline
```python
def clean_text(text):
    # URL removal with regex
    text = re.sub(r'http\S+|www\S+|https\S+', '', text, flags=re.MULTILINE)
    
    # Number removal while preserving context
    text = re.sub(r'\b\d+\b', '', text)
    
    # Punctuation cleaning (preserving apostrophes)
    text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s\']', '', text)
    
    # Normalization and lowercase conversion
    text = ' '.join(text.lower().split())
    return text
```

### Feature Engineering

# TF-IDF vectorization
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(
    max_features=25000,
    ngram_range=(1, 3),
    stop_words='english',
    min_df=2,
    max_df=0.95
)

# Model training and evaluation
model = LogisticRegression(C=1.0, max_iter=1000)
model.fit(X_train_vec, y_train)
